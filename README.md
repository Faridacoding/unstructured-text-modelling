## Text Analytics (Unsupervised Clustering) and Neural Network Modelling

The following Jupyter Notebook contains a tutorial on how to structure and build a predictive model for unlabelled text, using a combination of unsupervised learning (k-means clustering), and Neural Networks.

The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to pre-process and model unstructured/unlabelled text data, apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster dataset (e.g. cluster the text based on some measure of similarity), and finaly build and train a Neural Network to predict the assigned cluster label.

The purpose of this pipeline is to create a Labelled Dataset from Unlabelled unstructured data using a combination of tradtional unsupervised clustering and advanced machine learning techniques.
